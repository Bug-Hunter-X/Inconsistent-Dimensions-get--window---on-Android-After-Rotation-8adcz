This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` returns incorrect values, often reporting smaller dimensions than the actual screen size, especially after device rotation. This is inconsistent and unreliable.  The issue can lead to layout problems where components are cut off or displayed improperly.  

Example:
```javascript
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log('Width:', width, 'Height:', height);
// Incorrect values are logged on some Android devices after rotation.
```
